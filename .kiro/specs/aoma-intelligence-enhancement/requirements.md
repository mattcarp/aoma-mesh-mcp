# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AOMA Mesh MCP Server Enhancement project aims to transform the aoma-mesh-mcp server from providing methodological guidance ("Here's how to create a model...") to actually performing intelligent data analysis and generating actionable insights about the AOMA system ("Based on 6,280 AOMA tickets analyzed, here's the model, predictions, and what to do next"). This enhancement will integrate real data processing, machine learning capabilities, and executive-level reporting to make aoma-mesh-mcp a true AI data scientist rather than just a consultant for AOMA system analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want aoma-mesh-mcp to analyze actual AOMA system data and provide predictive insights, so that I can proactively prevent AOMA failures and optimize system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I query about AOMA system failures THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL analyze real AOMA Jira tickets, git commits, and system metrics to provide specific predictions with confidence intervals
2. WHEN requesting AOMA failure analysis THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL process actual data from the last 90 days and identify concrete patterns with statistical significance
3. WHEN asking for AOMA recommendations THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL provide actionable steps based on data analysis rather than generic methodologies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want aoma-mesh-mcp to build and deploy predictive models automatically for AOMA system analysis, so that I can get real-time AOMA failure probability assessments without manual data science work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting predictive analysis THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL automatically build machine learning models using available AOMA data sources
2. WHEN a model is created THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL provide accuracy metrics, feature importance, and prediction confidence intervals
3. WHEN predictions are generated THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL include specific timeframes, probability percentages, and risk thresholds for AOMA system issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want aoma-mesh-mcp to generate executive-level reports with visualizations about AOMA system health, so that I can understand AOMA performance and make informed decisions quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting AOMA system analysis THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL generate charts, correlation matrices, and trend visualizations
2. WHEN providing AOMA insights THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL include specific numbers, dates, and quantified impacts
3. WHEN presenting AOMA recommendations THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL prioritize actions by business impact and implementation effort

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want aoma-mesh-mcp to perform real-time root cause analysis of AOMA system issues, so that I can quickly identify and resolve AOMA problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reporting an AOMA system issue THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL analyze recent data to identify primary causes with supporting evidence
2. WHEN root cause is identified THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL provide specific code locations, configuration issues, or data patterns in the AOMA system
3. WHEN solutions are suggested THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL include implementation steps and expected resolution timeframes for AOMA fixes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want aoma-mesh-mcp to integrate with real AOMA data sources and processing pipelines, so that analysis is based on current, accurate AOMA system information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing analysis THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL connect to live Supabase data, AOMA git repositories, and AOMA system metrics
2. WHEN processing data THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL handle AOMA data aggregation, cleaning, and feature engineering automatically
3. WHEN AOMA data is unavailable THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL clearly indicate limitations and suggest alternative approaches

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want aoma-mesh-mcp to provide statistical validation and confidence metrics for AOMA analysis, so that I can trust the analysis and recommendations about AOMA system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are generated THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL provide accuracy scores, validation metrics, and confidence intervals
2. WHEN correlations are identified THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL include statistical significance and sample sizes from AOMA data
3. WHEN predictions are made THEN aoma-mesh-mcp SHALL clearly indicate uncertainty levels and risk factors for AOMA system behavior
