# JIRA 10.3 Upgrade Test Analysis Report

**Generated:** 2025-07-13T13:21:02.706Z
**Environment:** UAT (jirauat.smedigitalapps.com)
**Analyst:** Automated Analysis System
**For:** Irina's Team - JIRA Upgrade Validation

## üéØ Executive Summary

This report analyzes the comprehensive testing results for the JIRA 10.3 upgrade in the UAT environment. The analysis covers performance benchmarks, authentication regression testing, and end-to-end test results.

**Key Findings:**
- üî¥ **2 Critical Issues** requiring immediate attention
- üü† **4 High Priority Issues** needing resolution before production
- üü° **3 Medium Priority Issues** for optimization consideration
- üü¢ **0 Low Priority Issues** for future improvement

**Overall Recommendation:** ‚ùå **DO NOT PROCEED TO PRODUCTION** - Critical issues must be resolved first.

## üî¥ Critical Issues (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Issue Navigator has excessive load time (20928ms)
**Category:** Performance
**Impact:** Severely impacts user experience and productivity
**Recommendation:** Immediate optimization required - investigate database queries, caching, and resource loading

### 2. Login flow is completely broken - users stuck in redirect loop
**Category:** Authentication
**Impact:** BLOCKING: No users can access the system via automated tools or fresh sessions
**Recommendation:** IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Investigate authentication middleware, SSO configuration, and session handling in JIRA 10.3

## üü† High Priority Issues

### 1. ITSM Project has slow load time (8873ms)
**Category:** Performance
**Impact:** Degrades user experience and may cause user frustration
**Recommendation:** Optimize performance - review database queries and implement caching strategies

### 2. Session persistence issues between manual and automated sessions
**Category:** Authentication
**Impact:** Automated testing and monitoring tools cannot authenticate properly
**Recommendation:** Review session cookie configuration and implement proper session capture/restore mechanisms

### 3. permissionViolation parameter appears in login redirects
**Category:** Authentication
**Impact:** Suggests access control changes that may affect user permissions
**Recommendation:** Audit permission schemes and group memberships after upgrade

### 4. All Playwright E2E tests failing due to authentication issues
**Category:** Testing
**Impact:** Cannot validate critical user workflows automatically
**Recommendation:** Fix authentication issues first, then re-run comprehensive E2E test suite

## üü° Medium Priority Issues

### 1. Dashboard has moderate load time (5657ms)
**Category:** Performance
**Impact:** Acceptable but could be improved for better user experience
**Recommendation:** Consider performance optimizations during next maintenance window

### 2. Test timeout configurations insufficient for current performance
**Category:** Testing
**Impact:** Tests may fail due to timeouts rather than actual functionality issues
**Recommendation:** Adjust test timeouts to account for current system performance characteristics

### 3. Search functionality returning 0 results in performance tests
**Category:** Testing
**Impact:** May indicate search indexing issues or permission problems
**Recommendation:** Investigate search index status and re-index if necessary

## üìã Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Immediate optimization required - investigate database queries, caching, and resource loading
   - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Investigate authentication middleware, SSO configuration, and session handling in JIRA 10.3

2. **Before Production Deployment:**
   - Optimize performance - review database queries and implement caching strategies
   - Review session cookie configuration and implement proper session capture/restore mechanisms
   - Audit permission schemes and group memberships after upgrade
   - Fix authentication issues first, then re-run comprehensive E2E test suite

3. **Post-Deployment Optimization:**
   - Consider performance optimizations during next maintenance window
   - Adjust test timeouts to account for current system performance characteristics
   - Investigate search index status and re-index if necessary

4. **Re-testing Required:**
   - Re-run all E2E tests after authentication fixes
   - Validate performance improvements
   - Confirm search functionality is working
   - Test user workflows end-to-end
