# 🚨 JIRA 10.3 UPGRADE - COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT REPORT

**CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION: BLOCK UPGRADE DEPLOYMENT**

---

**Generated:** July 22, 2025  
**Environment:** https://jirauat.smedigitalapps.com  
**Testing Period:** July 2025  
**JIRA Version:** 10.3.6 UAT  
**Risk Level:** **CRITICAL**

---

## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### ⚠️ **RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT PROCEED WITH UPGRADE**

The JIRA 10.3 UAT environment contains a **system-breaking bug** that renders core ticket creation functionality completely non-functional. This critical failure, combined with severe performance degradation, creates unacceptable business risk.

### 💥 CRITICAL FINDINGS

- **🚨 CRITICAL:** Ticket creation functionality completely non-functional (0% success rate)
- **⚡ HIGH:** Severe performance degradation (9.8s page loads, 17s JS execution)
- **🛡️ MEDIUM:** 4 security vulnerabilities identified (1 high, 1 medium, 2 low)
- **⚠️ WARNING:** Core workflows severely impacted by performance issues

### 🎯 BUSINESS IMPACT

**The critical ticket creation failure makes JIRA 10.3 unusable for its primary purpose.** Users cannot create tickets despite being able to access the system, navigate interfaces, and fill forms. This represents a catastrophic risk that would impact all users and essential business workflows.

### 📊 RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX
