**SIAM is not just a tool; it's an experience.** It's the feeling of being in the command center of your own data, of seeing the unseen connections, of transforming the chaos of conversation into the clarity of insight. It's your meeting, but smarter, sleeker, and more cinematic than you've ever imagined.

*Experience meetings through a lens of glass and light*

## The Vision: A Symphony of Glass and Light ✨

We believe that the tools we use should not only be functional, but beautiful. That they should inspire us, empower us, and make the mundane feel magical. This is the heart of SIAM's design philosophy.

Our interface is a love letter to the future we were promised in films like *Minority Report* and *Blade Runner*. It's a world of semi-transparent overlays, of glowing data streams, of information that feels alive. It's a heads-up display (HUD) for your meetings, giving you the power to see, understand, and act on your conversations in real-time.

> *"This is not just about aesthetics; it's about a new way of interacting with information. It's about breaking free from the flat, boring interfaces of the past and stepping into a world where data is a landscape to be explored."*

### 🎬 Design Inspiration

SIAM draws inspiration from the most iconic interfaces in cinema and cutting-edge technology:

- **Minority Report**: Gestural interfaces and holographic data manipulation
- **Iron Man**: JARVIS-style AI integration and heads-up displays  
- **Blade Runner 2049**: Atmospheric lighting and holographic visualizations
- **Apple Vision Pro**: Modern glassmorphism and spatial computing
- **Cyberpunk 2077**: Neon aesthetics and cyberpunk data streams

*Explore our complete design inspiration in the [`/design`](design/) folder.*

```
Then open http://localhost:6006 to browse components interactively.

### Development Workflow

1. **Component Development**: Create new components in `siam-desktop/src/components/ui/`
2. **Interactive Testing**: Use the built-in Component Playground to test all props and variants
3. **Story Creation** (Optional): Add stories in `siam-desktop/src/stories/ComponentName.stories.tsx`
4. **Visual Regression**: Run Playwright tests against components
5. **Integration**: Import components into main app from `@/components/ui`

### Component Playground Features

The built-in playground provides:
- **Live Controls** - Real-time prop manipulation with sliders, dropdowns, and inputs
- **Multiple Variants** - See all component states and configurations at once
- **Interactive Examples** - System dashboard mockups and real-world use cases
- **Dark Theme** - JARVIS-style backgrounds matching the main app
- **No Build Issues** - Runs directly in the main Vite dev server

### Story Structure

Each component story includes:
- **Interactive Controls** - Real-time prop manipulation
