# üö® JIRA 10.3 UPGRADE - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION: **BLOCK UPGRADE DEPLOYMENT**

**Generated:** 7/30/2025  
**Environment:** https://jirauat.smedigitalapps.com  
**Risk Level:** **CRITICAL**

---

## üí• CRITICAL FINDINGS

- **CRITICAL: Ticket creation functionality completely non-functional (0% success rate)**
- **HIGH: Significant performance degradation (9.8s page loads)**
- **MEDIUM: 4 security vulnerabilities identified**
- **WARNING: JavaScript execution bottlenecks (17+ seconds)**

## üéØ BUSINESS IMPACT

The critical ticket creation failure makes JIRA 10.3 unusable for its core purpose. This represents a catastrophic risk that would impact all users and workflows.

## üìä RISK ASSESSMENT

| Category | Status | Impact |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Core Functionality** | ‚ùå **CRITICAL FAILURE** | Users cannot create tickets |
| **Performance** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **SIGNIFICANT ISSUES** | 9.8s page loads impact productivity |
| **Security** | ‚úÖ **ACCEPTABLE** | 4 findings, mostly low-medium severity |
| **Access Control** | ‚úÖ **FUNCTIONAL** | Authentication and permissions work |

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

1. **ESCALATE IMMEDIATELY: Block JIRA 10.3 upgrade deployment**
1. **Investigate ticket creation timeout root cause**
1. **Performance analysis of server-side components**
1. **Review database query performance during ticket creation**

---

**Bottom Line:** The critical ticket creation failure alone justifies blocking this upgrade. This is a **system-breaking bug** that would render JIRA unusable for its primary purpose.

**Next Steps:** Immediate escalation to development team for root cause analysis and resolution before any upgrade consideration.
