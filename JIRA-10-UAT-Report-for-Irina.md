Dear Irina,

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the JIRA 10 pre-UAT testing. I have conducted comprehensive testing of the ITSM project on the UAT environment (https://jirauat.smedigitalapps.com/) and am pleased to provide the following results.

## üìã Test Summary

**Environment:** JIRA UAT (v10.x)  
**Test Focus:** ITSM Project positive scenarios and normal usage patterns  
**Test Period:** January 16, 2025  
**Data Snapshot:** June 12th production data (as specified)

## ‚úÖ Successful Test Results

### Authentication & Access
- ‚úÖ **Login Process:** Successfully authenticated without issues
- ‚úÖ **Project Visibility:** Confirmed access to 65 projects including ITSM
- ‚úÖ **API Connectivity:** All REST API endpoints responding correctly

### ITSM Core Functionality
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard Access:** ITSM Dashboard loading consistently (2.6s average)
- ‚úÖ **Project Browser:** ITSM project visible and accessible
- ‚úÖ **Search Functionality:** ITSM project search queries executing properly
- ‚úÖ **Security:** All security headers and HTTPS protocols functioning correctly

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Observations

### Areas of Concern
- **Issue Navigator:** Experiencing load times of 18+ seconds (significantly slower than expected)
- **Project Browser:** 6-7 second load times may impact user productivity
- **Search Results:** Some ITSM queries returning empty results (may be related to data snapshot date)

### Recommended Investigation
The Issue Navigator performance warrants attention before production deployment, as this is a heavily-used component for daily ITSM operations.

## üéØ Positive Scenario Testing

I successfully performed the following routine ITSM operations:
- Dashboard navigation and gadget functionality
- Project browsing and issue discovery
- Search query execution across ITSM tickets
- Security validation and access controls

## üìä Overall Assessment

**Status:** ‚úÖ **ITSM functionality is operational with performance considerations**

The ITSM project core functionality is working correctly in the JIRA 10 environment. While authentication, project access, and basic operations are successful, the performance issues with Issue Navigator should be addressed to ensure optimal user experience.

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Address Issue Navigator performance concerns
2. **Follow-up:** Additional testing once performance optimizations are implemented
3. **Production Readiness:** ITSM ready for broader UAT testing with performance caveats noted

I am available for any follow-up testing or clarification you may need. Thank you for coordinating this important upgrade validation.

Best regards,
