- Issue Navigator
- Create Issue
- Projects
- Profile
- Public Pages

### Critical Findings

**🚨 Broken Navigation Links: 4**

**⚠️ Non-Functional UI Elements: 123**

✅ No timeout issues detected

### Detailed Findings

#### Broken Links
- **Issue Navigator**: "Skip to main content" (#main) - ERROR
- **Profile**: "Can't log in?" (/jira/secure/ForgotLoginDetails.jspa) - ERROR
- **Public Pages**: "Log in" (/jira/login.jsp?os_destination=%2Fdefault.jsp) - ERROR
- **Public Pages**: "Log In" (/jira/login.jsp?os_destination=%2Fdefault.jsp) - ERROR

#### UI Issues
- 123 elements appear clickable but are non-functional
- Dashboard: 10 non-functional elements that appear to be links
- Issue Navigator: 21 non-functional elements that appear to be links
- Create Issue: 7 non-functional elements that appear to be links
- Projects: 1 non-functional elements that appear to be links
- Profile: 15 non-functional elements that appear to be links
- Public Pages: 11 non-functional elements that appear to be links

#### Performance Issues
- 5 tests experienced slow response times (>10 seconds)

## Test Limitations

- Authentication testing was inconsistent and excluded from this report
- Session validation produced unreliable results and was removed
- Test coverage limited to public and accessible pages only
- Results depend on VPN connectivity and network conditions
- Automated testing may miss complex user interaction patterns

## Recommendations

- Fix identified broken navigation links before production deployment
- Review non-functional UI elements that appear clickable to users
- Establish reliable authentication testing methodology
- Implement consistent session management validation
- Add accessibility testing to test suite
