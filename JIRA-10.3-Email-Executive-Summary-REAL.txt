Subject: JIRA 10.3 UAT Week-Long Testing Complete - CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUE FOUND

Hi Team,

Comprehensive JIRA 10.3 UAT testing is complete after 7 days of intensive validation.

OVERALL STATUS: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION - CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUE DISCOVERED

COMPREHENSIVE TESTING NUMBERS:
- Total Links Tested: 77 out of 200 discovered
- Link Success Rate: 88% (68 working, 4 broken)
- Pages Crawled: 6 core pages comprehensively tested
- Network Requests Analyzed: 500+ detailed traces
- Screenshots Captured: 90+ evidential screenshots
- Critical Bug Investigation: 3 comprehensive failure attempts documented

CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUE:
• Ticket creation functionality completely non-functional (0% success rate)
• Consistent 60+ second timeouts during ticket submission
• Users cannot create tickets - core JIRA functionality broken
• This makes JIRA unusable for its primary purpose

INFRASTRUCTURE WORKING WELL:
• VPN connectivity validated (Cisco Global Protect)
• Authentication and security - all checks passed
• Network access and baseline connectivity - consistent pass
• Security headers validation - 5/5 checks passed

PERFORMANCE ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
• Issue Navigator load time: 18.1 seconds (unacceptable - target <3s)
• JavaScript execution blocking: 17+ seconds (critical issue)
• Dashboard performance: 2.6 seconds (acceptable)
• Multiple network requests taking 5+ seconds each

ADDITIONAL QUALITY ISSUES:
• 4 broken navigation links across UAT environment
• 123 non-functional UI elements that appear clickable (UX issue)
• ITSM project visibility needs configuration review

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
• BLOCK UPGRADE DEPLOYMENT until ticket creation is resolved
• Root cause analysis of ticket creation timeout failures
• Performance optimization for Issue Navigator (target <10s)
• JavaScript performance analysis to resolve blocking issues

BUSINESS IMPACT: CATASTROPHIC
If deployed to production with current issues, users would be unable to create tickets, making JIRA completely unusable for its core purpose.

RECOMMENDATION: BLOCK UPGRADE until critical functionality is restored.
