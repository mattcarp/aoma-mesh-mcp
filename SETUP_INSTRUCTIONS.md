## üåê Optional: Enable SSE MCP Transport

To enable the SSE transport endpoint in the main server, add the following variables to your `.env.local` in the project root:

```
# Enable SSE transport endpoint alongside stdio/http
ENABLE_SSE_TRANSPORT=false

# Path where the SSE endpoint will be exposed in Express
SSE_ENDPOINT_PATH=/mcp/sse

# Comma-separated list of allowed origins specifically for SSE
# Example: https://studio.chat,https://myapp.local
SSE_CORS_ORIGINS=
```
