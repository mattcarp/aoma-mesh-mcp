    A[User clicks Create] --> B[Create Dialog Opens ‚úÖ]
    B --> C[User fills form ‚úÖ]
    C --> D[User clicks Submit]
    D --> E[TIMEOUT 60+ seconds ‚ùå]
    E --> F[No ticket created ‚ùå]
    
    style E fill:#ff6b6b
    style F fill:#ff6b6b
```

**Evidence:**
- CRITICAL-TICKET-CREATION-BUG-REPORT-*.json
- 15+ step-by-step failure screenshots
- Network logs showing submission hangs
- Browser console errors during submission

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. 1. Navigate to JIRA dashboard
2. 2. Click Create button
3. 3. Fill required fields (Project, Issue Type, Summary)
4. 4. Click Create/Submit
5. 5. Observe 60+ second timeout with no ticket creation

## ‚ö° PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

```mermaid
gantt
    title JIRA 10.3 Performance Issues
    dateFormat X
    axisFormat %Ls
    
    section Page Loading
    Dashboard Load     :0, 9800
    Issue Navigator   :0, 9800
    
    section Expected Performance
    Target Load Time  :0, 3000
    
    section JavaScript Execution
    JS Processing     :0, 17000
    Expected JS Time  :0, 2000
```

### Performance Findings:

**Issue Navigator Load Time**
- Measured: 9.8 seconds average
- Expected: < 3 seconds expected
- Impact: User productivity significantly impacted by slow navigation
- Recommendation: Performance optimization required before deployment

**JavaScript Execution Time**
- Measured: 17+ seconds blocking
- Expected: < 2 seconds expected
- Impact: Browser freezing and poor user experience
- Recommendation: JavaScript performance analysis and optimization

**Page Load Network Timing**
- Measured: Multiple 5+ second requests
- Expected: < 1 second for API calls
- Impact: Network latency suggests server-side performance issues
- Recommendation: Server-side performance investigation required

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY ASSESSMENT

```mermaid
pie title Security Findings by Severity
    "Low (2)" : 2
    "Medium (1)" : 1
    "High (1)" : 1
```

### Security Findings:

**Authentication & Session Management** (LOW)
- OWASP: A02:2021 ‚Äì Cryptographic Failures
- Session handling appears secure with proper JSESSIONID management
- Evidence: Manual session testing confirmed proper timeout and invalidation

**Access Control** (LOW)
- OWASP: A01:2021 ‚Äì Broken Access Control
- Role-based access controls functioning correctly
- Evidence: ITSM admin panel access properly restricted

**Input Validation** (MEDIUM)
- OWASP: A03:2021 ‚Äì Injection
- Form validation present but needs testing under high load
- Evidence: Create ticket form shows validation, but timeout prevents full testing

**Error Handling** (HIGH)
- OWASP: A09:2021 ‚Äì Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- System timeout errors not providing clear user feedback
- Evidence: Ticket creation timeouts show generic browser errors instead of helpful messages

## üéØ FUNCTIONAL TESTING RESULTS

```mermaid
pie title Functional Test Results
    "Pass (2)" : 2
    "Warning (2)" : 2  
    "Fail (1)" : 1
```

### Detailed Results:

**User Authentication**: ‚úÖ PASS
- Login functionality works correctly with session persistence
- Evidence: Multiple successful login sessions captured

**Dashboard Navigation**: ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Dashboard accessible but with significant performance issues
- Evidence: Dashboard loads but takes 9.8+ seconds

**Issue Navigator**: ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Navigation works but severely impacted by performance
- Evidence: Filtering and search functional but extremely slow

**Admin Panel Access**: ‚úÖ PASS
- Administrative functions accessible with proper permissions
- Evidence: ITSM admin panel testing successful

**Ticket Creation**: ‚ùå FAIL
- Core ticket creation functionality completely non-functional
- Evidence: CRITICAL-TICKET-CREATION-BUG-REPORT with 0% success rate

## üìã RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions:
- ESCALATE IMMEDIATELY: Block JIRA 10.3 upgrade deployment
- Investigate ticket creation timeout root cause
- Performance analysis of server-side components
- Review database query performance during ticket creation

### Before Upgrade:
- Resolve ticket creation functionality completely
- Performance optimization to achieve <3s page loads
- JavaScript performance analysis and optimization
- Security vulnerability remediation for error handling
- Load testing under realistic user volumes

### Post-Upgrade:
- Continuous performance monitoring implementation
- User acceptance testing with real workflows
- Security audit of upgraded components
- Performance baseline establishment
- User training on any interface changes
