# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SECURITY REMINDER ðŸš¨

## NEVER COMMIT API KEYS OR SECRETS TO GITHUB

This is a **CARDINAL SIN** in software development. No exceptions, no excuses.

### What Happened:
- API keys were accidentally committed in example files
- GitHub push protection blocked deployment (rightfully so)
- Had to rewrite git history and create clean branch

### Why This is Unacceptable:
- **Security Risk**: Exposed OpenAI API keys, Supabase keys
- **Professional Standards**: Amateur-hour mistake
- **Repository Compromise**: Forced history rewriting
- **Time Waste**: Hours spent fixing preventable issue

### NEVER AGAIN RULES:
1. **Always use placeholder values** in example files (e.g., `your-api-key-here`)
2. **Double-check all commits** before pushing
3. **Use .env files** for real keys (already in .gitignore)
4. **Implement pre-commit hooks** to scan for secrets
5. **Review diffs carefully** before any git operations

### Pre-commit Hook Task Added:
- Install and configure pre-commit hooks with secret scanning
- Use tools like `detect-secrets` or `git-secrets`
- Block commits containing API keys, tokens, passwords

## REMINDER: 
**Professional developers NEVER commit secrets. Period.**
